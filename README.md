# Slice for Visual Studio Code

This language extension adds support for highlighting Slice files within Visual Studio Code.
It supports highlighting the following file types:

- `.ice` files, which use the [original Slice](https://doc.zeroc.com/ice/latest/the-slice-language) syntax
- `.slice` files, which use the [latest Slice](https://docs.icerpc.dev/slice2) syntax

Additionally, this extension provides a Slice Language Server, for `.slice` files only.
